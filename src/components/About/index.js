        Hello, my name is Juan Pablo and it's a pleasure to meet you. I am a 29 year old Colombian engineer, born in the city of Medellin. After moving to North Carolina and working as an onsite Spanish medical 
        interpreter for a couple of years, I decided to go back to my engineering roots and embark on this new adventure of web developing. Hopefully you'll enjoy my work and I am always open to constructive criticism
        as I look to grow as a developer.
